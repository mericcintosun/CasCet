# CasCet — Final Round Plan (Jul 21 → 26, 2026)

Casper Agentic Buildathon 2026 · qualified for the final round · deadline **Jul 26**.
Solo (Meriç). This is the working plan for the last 5 days. Newest status at the
bottom of each workstream.

## Where we start (already shipped in qualification)

7 contracts live on Casper Testnet · real x402 settlement (no mock) · the
`CascadeController` primitive (budget tree + recursive attribution) · an autonomous
LLM buyer (`@cascet/agent`, simulated reasoning by default) · live dashboard +
cascade playground + x402 explorer · a proposed x402-MCP spec · CI/CodeQL/Dependabot
+ community-health files · live socials (X + Discord).

## Locked decisions (Jul 21)

- **Network:** stay on **testnet** for the final round; mainnet is deferred (needs
  real CSPR + its own gate).
- **Deployer balance:** ~2,493 CSPR on testnet — sufficient for all planned on-chain
  work (gas-light: `release()` / anchors ~5 CSPR each; no new deploys required).
- **W4 control plane:** ship the **safe config-generator wizard**, not a hosted
  runtime gateway (too risky in 5 days). Copy stays honest: hosted runtime = roadmap.
- **W5 Discord:** Meriç owns it (automated via `tools/discord`); out of the agent's
  scope.
- **W1 real agent:** gated on Meriç adding **$5 Anthropic API credit** (API billing
  is separate from the Claude Code Max/Pro plan). His call.
- **Workflow:** commit/push/deploy freely once verified green (no per-step ask);
  `npm publish` still gets an explicit name/go confirmation (irreversible public act).

## Workstreams (ranked by leverage)

| # | Item | Criteria hit | Effort | Blocker |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| W1 | ✅ **DONE (free)** — real Claude live via Claude Code + `cascet connect` (`connect-demo`); no API purchase, real x402 | agentic AI | low | — |
| W2 | ✅ **DONE** — `@cascet/{core,client,gateway,cli}` on npm (`npx @cascet/cli`) | technical execution + long-term | med | — |
| W3 | ✅ **DONE** — `/withdraw`: Casper Wallet connect + real on-chain `release` (verified live) | working contracts + UX | med | — |
| W4 | ✅ **DONE** — `/build`: config-generator wizard (live cascet.config.json + commands) | real-world + long-term | med | — |
| W6 | Demo video refresh | UX / communication | med | W1/W3 done |
| W7 | ✅ **DONE** — on-chain-backed explorer: rebuilds the economy from ReceiptRegistry `record` txs via CSPR.cloud (8 receipts, live) | ecosystem impact | med | — |
| W8 | ✅ **DONE** — submission/README/BUIDL refresh + consistency fixes + CI contract-test job + full QA green | all | low | — |

\* W1 code is proven (`CASCET_AGENT_LIVE=1`); only the credit is missing.

(W5 = Discord is Meriç's, tracked in `docs/discord-mcp-handoff.md` + `tools/discord`.)

## Day-by-day

- **Day 1 · Jul 21 (done):** fixed 3 doc/UI inconsistencies (test count 13/13,
  7 contracts on landing, socials wired live) + deployed. Automated the Discord
  server (`tools/discord`) and configured it live. Patched a high-sev dependency
  (brace-expansion). **W2 shipped:** `@cascet/{core,client,gateway,cli}` published
  to npm via a `Publish to npm` GitHub Actions workflow (NPM_TOKEN secret,
  2FA-bypass token); `npx @cascet/cli` verified working from the registry.
- **Day 2 · Jul 22:** finish W2 (publish + verify `npx @cascet/cli@latest`); run + record
  W1 if credit is added.
- **Day 3 · Jul 23:** W3 — withdraw UI + CSPR.click wallet connect; verify `release`
  on testnet; deploy.
- **Day 4 · Jul 24:** W4 — control-plane wizard page (config generator + commands +
  live preview); deploy.
- **Day 5 · Jul 25:** W6 — demo video refresh; W8 — BUIDL page + submission update,
  full QA (`pnpm build/typecheck`, `cargo odra test`, e2e all green), final deploy.
  Stretch: W7.
- **Day 6 · Jul 26 (deadline, buffer):** DoraHacks BUIDL + video + socials final;
  contingency for anything that slipped.

## Definition of done (per item)

Build/test green → commit → push → (if UI/site) deploy → verify live. Contract
changes run `cargo odra test`; frontend runs `typecheck` + `next build`; end-to-end
flows run `pnpm --filter @cascet/e2e demo`.

## Verification snapshot (Jul 22)

`pnpm build` ✓ · `pnpm typecheck` ✓ · `cargo odra test` **13/13** ✓ · plain
`cargo test` **13/13** ✓ · e2e cascade demo **PASS** ✓ · dashboard prod build ✓ ·
CI green (Build & typecheck + **Contract tests**) ✓ · live pages
/ /build /withdraw /explorer /playground + /api/onchain (count 8) all 200 ✓.

Shipped this round: W2 (npm), W3 (withdraw), W4 (build wizard), W7 (on-chain
explorer), W8 (submission/QA). Remaining: W6 (demo video refresh — Meriç records),
W1 (declined). Site: https://cascet.vercel.app
